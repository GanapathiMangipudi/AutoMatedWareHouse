This js application helps us in finding the best fit unit for shipment that needs to be shipped.
The application uses stack and queue data structures to find when a unit should be placed in a truck or a container and how they must be delivered out for shipping.
Packages arriving on conveyor belt will be processed using queue data structure
Truck or container will deliver the last placed shipment first using stack data structure
We will also use binarysearch to find out which inventory is suitable for each package.
We log the shipments in shipment_logs table
